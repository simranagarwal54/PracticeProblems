DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARRAY AND LINKED LIST

The size of the arrays is fixed: 
So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. 
Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage, and in practical uses, upper limit is rarely reached.

Inserting and deeting a new element in an array of elements is expensive,

So Linked list provides following two advantages over arrays
1)	Dynamic size
2)	Ease of insertion/deletion

Linked lists have following drawbacks:
1)	Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists.
2)	Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
3) Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.
