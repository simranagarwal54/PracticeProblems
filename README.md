# PracticeProblemsOnArrays-Strings

1. Given a string S, containing special characters and all the alphabets, reverse the string without
affecting the positions of the special characters. (reverseArraySpeacialChar.c)

2. Given an array A[] and a number x, check for pair in A[] with sum as x. (sumOfPairs.c)

3. Find maximum of minimum for every window size in a given array. (maxOfMin.c)

4. Findind peak element in an array. Peak element is the one which is greater than both its neighbours. (peak.c)

5. Given an odd number in the form of string, the task is to make largest even number possible from the given number provided one is allowed to do only one swap operation, if no such number is possible then print the input string itself. (OddToEven.c)

6. A sorted array A[ ] with distinct elements is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it.
Expected Time Complexity: O(log n)

7. Kandane's Algorithm: Given an array containing both negative and positive integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum.

8. Traverse a 4x4 matrix of integers in spiral form. (SpiralTraverse.c)
